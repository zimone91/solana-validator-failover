# Safety model

## Prime directive

**Never let two nodes hold and vote the same staked identity at the same time (double-sign).**

Every decision in this system is designed to fail toward *unstaked / stop / page the operator* rather
than toward two nodes voting. Availability loss (a brief voting gap) is always preferred over a
double-sign.

## The cross-node invariant

A spare must not take the staked identity until the previous holder has **provably relinquished** it.
Two independent mechanisms enforce this:

1. **Holder self-fence (~30s).** A PRIMARY that loses its local RPC, stops advancing its slot, or whose
   own votes stop landing (egress-only partition) demotes *itself* to its unstaked identity. A node on
   its unstaked identity structurally cannot vote the staked account.
2. **Spare takeover delay + vote-liveness fence.** The STANDBY waits `TAKEOVER_DELAY`
   (default **60s** = the holder's ~30s self-fence worst case + a 30s cross-node margin) **and** confirms
   via external RPC that the staked vote account has **stopped advancing** before it takes. Gossip
   presence alone is treated as advisory (a staked identity lingers in gossip for ~48h), so the
   authoritative signal is vote-liveness, not gossip.

```
t0        PRIMARY isolated
t0+~30s   PRIMARY self-fences → unstaked           (holder relinquishes)
t0+60s    STANDBY confirms vote frozen → takes     (spare takes)
          └─ 30s margin between the two: no overlap
```

A hand-edited `TAKEOVER_DELAY` below the safe floor **refuses to start** (opt-out only via
`ALLOW_UNSAFE_TIMING=true`, for labs). For a 3-node setup the BACKUP floor is stricter still — it must
also outwait the STANDBY's takeover becoming externally visible.

## Failure directions

| Situation | Resolves toward |
|---|---|
| Holder loses local RPC / frozen slot / egress-only | self-fence to unstaked |
| Ambiguous whether the holder relinquished | spare **does not** take (waits / pages) |
| Promoted STANDBY later isolates | self-fence + 600s re-take lockout |
| A demote (`set-identity`) wedges | escalate to stop the validator + page |
| Timing config unsafe | refuse to start |
| Both external RPCs unreachable | cannot confirm → **hold**, do not take |

## Detection

- **Local delinquency** via a sliding window (DDoS-flicker resistant), confirmed on an external tier.
- **Frozen slot / dead RPC** (isolation the node can see).
- **Egress-only partition** — the node still reaches the internet and its RPC answers, but its *own*
  votes stop landing on-chain; detected by comparing its own last vote against the cluster max.

## Residual risks (be honest with yourself)

- The system trades availability for safety: a genuine failover has a voting gap of roughly one takeover
  delay. That is intentional.
- The gossip **fast-path** (Option A, off by default) is a conservative, fail-closed optimization that
  in practice rarely fires; the proven path is the timer + vote-liveness fence.
- On-chain slashing for double-signing is not (yet) enforced by the Solana network, but this system is
  built as if it were — do not weaken the fences.
- Always test on testnet, and roll to mainnet one node at a time.
